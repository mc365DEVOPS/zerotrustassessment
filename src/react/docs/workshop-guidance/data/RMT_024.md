# 024: Plan for the protection of Critical Assets

## Overview

For each type of critical asset identified previously, determine the type of special data security or cryptographic needs based on the business use case, industry regulatory compliance requirements and any other applicable constraints. Plan accordingly considering the technology, process, and people aspects of the change. These can include physical access and hardware considerations, identity and device special considerations for the user accounts and devices used with the critical assets, and special cryptographic needs among others.
