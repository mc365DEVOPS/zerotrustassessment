# 037: Conditional launch

## Overview
### Conditional Launch Settings for MAM in Microsoft Intune

**Conditional Launch settings** in Microsoft Intune's Mobile Application Management (MAM) policies help ensure that only compliant users can access corporate data via MAM protected apps. These settings validate various aspects of the app and device before allowing access to work or school account data.

#### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: Ensures that only users meeting specific criteria can access sensitive data in procted apps, reducing the risk of data breaches.
2. **Data Protection**: Allows for selective wiping of corporate data atthe application level(e.g., jailbroken/rooted devices).
3. **Compliance Enforcement**: Helps organizations enforce compliance with security policies across MAM protected apps. 
4. **Flexibility**: Offers a range of settings to tailor security measures to specific organizational needs.

#### Drawbacks
1. **Complex Configuration**: Setting up and managing these policies can be complex and may require significant administrative effort.
2. **User Disruption**: Users may experience disruptions if their devices or apps do not meet the compliance requirements, potentially impacting productivity.
3. **Resource Intensive**: Implementing and maintaining these policies can be resource-intensive, requiring dedicated IT staff.

#### Impact on End Users
1. **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced security measures, protecting their personal and corporate data with almost no impact to end users.
2. **Access Restrictions**: Users may face access restrictions if their devices do not comply with the set policies, which could limit their ability to work.

#### Relation to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes breaches are inevitable and focuses on verifying every request as though it originates from an open network. Conditional Launch settings in Intune support Zero Trust principles in several ways:

1. **Verify Explicitly**: Policies ensure that every device and user is verified before granting access.
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Policies enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring users have only the access they need.
3. **Assume Breach**: Intune integrates with threat detection and response services to monitor and respond to potential threats in real-time.
