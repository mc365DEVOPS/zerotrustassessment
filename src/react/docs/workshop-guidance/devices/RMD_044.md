# 044: SafetyNet/ Hardware Back Key

## Overview
### SafetyNet/Hardware Back Key Settings for MAM in Microsoft Intune

**SafetyNet** and **Hardware Back Key** settings in Microsoft Intune's Mobile Application Management (MAM) policies are designed to enhance security by ensuring that only compliant devices can access corporate data.

#### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: SafetyNet attestation checks ensure that devices are not compromised (e.g., rooted or jailbroken), providing a higher level of security¹.
2. **Hardware Backed Attestation**: This feature leverages hardware-backed security to provide more robust root detection, making it harder for malicious actors to bypass security measures¹.
