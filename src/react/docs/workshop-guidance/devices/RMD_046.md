# 046: MAM Compliance and Conditional Access

## Overview
### MAM Compliance and MAM Conditional Access Settings in Microsoft Intune

**MAM Compliance** and **MAM Conditional Access** settings in Microsoft Intune are designed to ensure that only compliant devices and applications can access corporate data. These settings help enforce security policies and protect sensitive information.

#### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: Ensures that only compliant devices and applications can access corporate resources, reducing the risk of data breaches.
2. **Data Protection**: Protects corporate data by enforcing compliance policies and restricting access to non-compliant devices.
3. **Flexibility**: Allows organizations to tailor security measures to their specific needs, providing a balance between security and usability.
4. **Compliance Enforcement**: Helps organizations meet regulatory requirements by enforcing security policies consistently.


#### Impact on End Users
1. **Improved Security**: Users benefit from enhanced security measures, protecting their personal and corporate data.
2. **Access Restrictions**: Users may face access restrictions if their devices do not comply with the set policies, which could limit their ability to work.
3. **Consistent Experience**: Provides a consistent security experience across all devices, ensuring users know what to expect.

#### Relation to Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model that assumes breaches are inevitable and focuses on verifying every request as though it originates from an open network. MAM Compliance and Conditional Access settings in Intune support Zero Trust principles in several ways:

1. **Verify Explicitly**: Policies ensure that every device and user is verified before granting access.
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Policies enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring users have only the access they need.
3. **Assume Breach**: Intune integrates with threat detection and response services to monitor and respond to potential threats in real-timeÂ¹
